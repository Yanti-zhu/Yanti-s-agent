Sales Analyst AI Agent (Databricks)

📌 Overview

This project is a Sales Analyst AI Agent built in Databricks. It uses natural language queries and translates them into SQL function calls, providing data-driven sales insights such as revenue trends, customer purchases, and top-selling products.

The agent was designed as part of my personal portfolio to demonstrate how AI orchestration and data engineering can be combined to build intelligent, query-driven business tools.

🔧 Features

System Prompt Design – guides the agent to prefer function calls over guesses for accuracy.

Reusable SQL Functions:

fn_monthly_revenue – monthly revenue trends.
fn_customer_purchases – purchase history for customers.
fn_query_sales – sales data with customer/product details.
fn_top_products_by_year – top-N products by year.
fn_top_months_by_year – highest revenue months per year.
fn_customer_by_year – top customers by revenue.
Agent Orchestration – dynamically picks the right function, runs it, and summarises results.
Playground Integration – deployed in Databricks Playground for interactive Q&A.
